# DH-110-Assignment-2

Instructions:
Review the design of existing time management tools, both digital and analog.

Talk with at least three students who are not in the class about time management and their experience and habits as students.

Conduct an iterative design process to articulate application functionality, information architecture, and user personas and user journey that describes a time management application that is specific to the needs and preferences of college students.

Document all steps of the process. Publish your documentation using GitHub pages. Each individual should submit the URL for the website. 

# Introduction
This is our DH 110 documentation on our time management application. The goal of this application is to have a time management tool that allows students to better organize their tasks while also boosting productivity (higher accomplishment rate). By conducting interviews and data through a Google Form, we were able to get a glimpse of how students feel about their time management skills and needs and wants in a time management tool. Below is our iterative process that combines productivity with an aesthetic reward system.

# Application Functionality
Our time management tool features four main pages: home page, calendar, to do list, and study session. Below we will list the functionality of each page. We made multiple iterations of how calendars are visualized, how assignments can be kept track of, and how gameifying the experience coul dlead to higher productivity.

## Home Page
The home page provides space that is pleasing to the eye of students and recreates a physical desktop. It displays various widgets that will take you to the different pages, and also a display for the prizes you earn while completing tasks. It is also the home of the main reward feature of this application: the mystery box. Here it displays the progress bar to opening it. 

## Calendar
The calendar page allows the user to keep track of all events/assignments they have in a convenient matter. The main feature is the ability to add an event with the date, category, time, location, and any description. The user is also able to change the display from year, month, week, and day. In addition to creating events and changing the display of the calendar, the user can also create their own categories to organize different events/assignments.

## To-Do List
The To-Do list page creates a space to list out assignments and order them based on priority. Creating a task involves a title, description, due date, priority, and category. Once completed, the user can check it off and it will be displayed in the completed section. 

## Study Session
The study session page allows the used to set a timer in order to follow time management techniques. Features a settings button, restart button, and music widget. This page also displays the to do list. 


# Information Architecture

# User Personas
User personas can be found at [this link](https://www.figma.com/file/GPJxxETwDxRtRMI2JHvb2R/User-Persona?type=design&node-id=0%3A1&mode=design&t=Ts6mkRI3PBu8y4LO-1).
Below is a general idea of our user personas:
- Target audience: College Students
  - any gender
- Experience with time management tools: beginner to advanced/daily usage
- Expected usage (where/when): 
  - Desktop (browser)
  - Daily usage 
  - Used when adding new items, checking off items, during study times
- want/need: a better tool/way to manage their time/tasks
  - A more all-in-one platform 
- Frustrations: bad at time management
  - Using multiple time management tools at the same time for different needs
  - Difficulty prioritizing tasks


# User Journey
User journey can be found at [this link](https://www.figma.com/file/vIECxlx5fW1dsU9nlJs6GU/DH-110%3A-Information-Architecture-and-User-Journey?type=whiteboard&node-id=0%3A1&t=FP45YPhi6fW4Ro7U-1).
- Student gets presented with tasks
- Having trouble grasping the multiple tasks at the same time, needs to organize
- Searches for a time management tool, faced with too many options to choose from
- Tries to narrow down search by specifying a more all in one platform
- **Goal:** having a time management tool that allows students to better organize their tasks while also boosting productivity (higher accomplishment rate)
